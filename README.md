## Prerequisites

- CUDA Toolkit (Version 10.2): The project relies on CUDA for GPU acceleration. You'll need to install the CUDA Toolkit to compile and run the CUDA code. Visit the [NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit page](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit) for installation instructions.
- C++ Compiler
- GPU NVIDIA Jetson Xavier: The project is designed to run on NVIDIA Jetson Xavier or other compatible GPUs.

## Available Models

The library includes several pre-configured CNN model architectures, each tailored for efficient inference on CUDA-enabled GPUs:

1. **Model 1 (model1.dat):**
   - Configured with a CUDA-accelerated Convolutional Layer, Max Pooling, and Fully Connected Layers.

2. **Model 2 (model2.dat):**
   - Another example architecture with variations in layer sizes and configurations, optimized for GPU parallel processing.

## Usage

To leverage the CUDA-accelerated CNN models in your project:

1. Load the desired model configuration from the corresponding `.dat` file.

2. Integrate the configuration into your deep learning framework with CUDA support.

3. Utilize the CUDA-accelerated inference capabilities for improved performance on NVIDIA GPUs.

## Customization

This library provides a starting point for CUDA-accelerated CNN model configurations. Customize the models by adjusting the number of output channels, kernel sizes, stride, padding, and the number of output neurons in the fully connected layers. Tailor the configurations to match the requirements of your specific dataset and inference tasks.

## Performance Considerations

The library incorporates optimizations for maximizing performance on CUDA-enabled GPUs. Consider adjusting the number of CUDA warps, blocks, and threads for further performance tuning based on your hardware capabilities.
